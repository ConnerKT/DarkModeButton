# DarkModeButton



This is a Dark mode project I made with JavaScript, HTML , and CSS.
This program is really cool because you can add it to your site, and it will universally change your colors.

Its all in JavaScript!

## Want to add it to you code?

The code in the javascript is a function you can use in your code to run it, just add it to a button of your choice and make sure to listen for an event!
